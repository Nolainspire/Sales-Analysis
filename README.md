### Project Overview
This project transforms raw sales data into clean, structured, and reliable information. It involves data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies, followed by analysis to uncover key insights such as sales trends, top products, regional performance, and customer behavior.

### Tool
  Excel - Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization Report.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

To ensure accuracy and reliability of insights, the dataset undergoes thorough cleaning:
- Identification and handling of missing values in key fields such as Quantity Sold, Payment Method, and Sales Rep.
- Removal of leading and trailing spaces across text fields.
- Standardization of text casing for consistency in names, product categories, and payment methods.
- Correction of inconsistencies and blank values to maintain data integrity.
- Detection and removal of duplicate records.
- Converting data types (e.g., dates to proper formats, numeric fields to integers/floats) for analysis readiness.

### üìä Sales & Customer Insights

### Key Metrics 
  - Total Orders - 2,000 orders was recorded.

  
  - Total Quantity Sold - 101,955 units was sold across all products.

  
  - Avg. Unit Price - Average unit price of products at $2.6K. 

  
  - Total Sales - Total sales of $259.7M was generated across all products.

### Top 5 Products by Sales Volume
  Energy Drink (6.9K units) is the top-selling product.
  Bleach (5.9K), Detergent (5.7K), Tomato Paste (5.6K), and Soap (5.6K) round out the top 5.

  Collectively, the top 5 products account for 29.2% of total sales volume, showing that while these items are important,       most sales come from a wide range of other      products.

### Average Price by Category
  Snacks and Cleaning Supplies have the highest average price ($2.6K), while Personal Care, Beverages, and Packaged Food are slightly lower ($2.5K).

  Prices are fairly similar across categories, indicating customers purchase based on need rather than price differences.

### Payment Methods
  Bank Transfer leads with 678 transactions, followed closely by Cash (664) and POS/Card (636). Only 22 transactions were       unknown.
  Customers uses mix of payment methods, so making payments easy and reliable is key.

### Monthly Sales Trend
  Sales fluctuate month-to-month, ranging from $17.2M in April (lowest) to $24.0M in July (highest). There is a general         pattern of strong sales in mid-year (May‚ÄìJuly), possibly due to seasonal demands. Sales dip slightly in April and             September, indicating periods where additional marketing or campaigns could boost revenue.

  Overall, the monthly sales are relatively stable, showing consistent business performance throughout the year.

### Sales Performance by Reps
  The largest portion of sales, $4.0M, is recorded under ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù (likely unassigned/system-recorded). Among known Sales reps, Charles Anderson ($564.6K) leads, followed by Adam Williams ($519.1K), Robert Thomas ($518.5K), and Daniel Holmes       ($485K).

  Focusing on top performers and clarifying unknown sales rep can improve tracking and team performance.

### Sales by Channel
  Online sales ($88.5M) lead, with Wholesale ($87.1M) and Retail Stores ($84.1M) close behind.
  Sales are balanced across channels, indicating a strong presence online and offline, with room to grow each channel further.

### Customer Feedback
  Most common responses: ‚ÄúProduct not as described‚Äù (13.5%), ‚ÄúExcellent!‚Äù / ‚ÄúAverage experience‚Äù (13.3%), and Customers (No     feedback 13%) did not provide any comment.      Issues like late delivery (12.1%) and poor packaging (11%) exist but are less      frequent.
  Feedback shows opportunities to improve delivery and packaging while maintaining overall customer satisfaction.

### Executive Recommendations
  - Promote Top Products: Run targeted promotions or bundles for top-selling items to boost revenue and cross-sell mid-performing products.
  - Fix Unknown Sales Tracking: Assign all transactions to representatives and implement system checks to improve performance visibility.
  - Improve Delivery & Packaging: Introduce better packaging and real-time delivery tracking to reduce complaints and increase satisfaction.
  - Optimize Weak Months: Launch seasonal campaigns or limited-time offers in April and September to stabilize sales.

### Limitations
  - Incomplete or Unknown Data: A significant portion of sales ($4.0M) is recorded under ‚ÄúUnknown,‚Äù which limits the accuracy of sales rep performance analysis.
  - Limited Timeframe: The analysis is based on a single year of sales data, so seasonal trends or long-term patterns beyond this period are not captured.

### Conclusion
This project successfully transformed raw sales data into structured, actionable insights. Through cleaning, standardizing,   and analyzing the data, I uncovered key trends in product performance, pricing, sales channels, sales reps, and customer     feedback. The findings highlight opportunities to boost revenue through top products, improve delivery and packaging,         optimize pricing, and enhance sales tracking. Overall, this project demonstrates how data-driven insights can guide        strategic decisions and improve business performance.
